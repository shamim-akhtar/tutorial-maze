This repository comprises the source codes for my tutorial on how to implement mazes in Unity2D by applying the backtracking algorithm with an explicit stack. Read the complete tutorial [Implement Mazes in Unity2D](https://faramira.com/implement-mazes-in-unity2d/)

## Introduction to Mazes
Not too far ago, mazes were somewhat central to video games. Arguably, the original first-person shooter game, literally named Maze, was created by students on Imlac computers at a NASA laboratory in 1974 â€“ source [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_War).

Mazes have long been a staple in video games, offering players a challenging and immersive experience as they navigate through winding pathways and hidden corridors. And now, with Unity, you can bring these intricate mazes to life in your own projects. 
In this tutorial, we will take you through the step-by-step process of generating mazes in Unity2D, from setting up your project to implementing the backtracking algorithm for maze generation. By the end of this video, you'll have the skills and knowledge to create captivating mazes that will keep your players engaged and entertained.
